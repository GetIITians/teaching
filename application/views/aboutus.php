				<h4 class="grey-text text-darken-4">Our Vision</h4>
				<p class="grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:18px;">We imagine a world where a student will be at the center of learning again. Where a teacher will teach according to the need, pace and level of a student. Where learning graduates from One-to-Many to 1-to-1.</p>

			<div class="col-xs-6">
				<h4 class="grey-text text-darken-4">Our Mission</h4>
				<p class="grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:18px;">For personalization to happen, technology will definitely help. But more importantly there has to be a system free of institutions where learning is bound within four walls. We imagine a world free of such middle layers, where a student is directly connected to a teacher and learning-teaching happens in a personalized way. Imagine a world with Knowledge Democracy.</p>
